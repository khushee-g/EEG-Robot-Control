Welcome to the EEG Robot Control webpage. Here, I’ll cover how to control a M-Bot with EEG(electroencephalography) signals from start to finish. If you would like to follow along, check out the step-but-step YouTube tutorial or my GitHub repository.

### Inception 
This project started after I first began using a Muse EEG headband. The headset was designed for tracking sleep quality, but when used with third-party apps, I could use it to acquire raw EEG data in real time. Doing so, I saw my own brain waves being captured, and I became curious to learn more. 

My first EEG work was focused on analyzing biomarkers in the eyes-closed and eyes-open state, and through this I found that the brain exhibits fluctuations in alpha wave activity as we relax and close our eyes. This was my first step towards understanding EEG, but I still had yet to apply this technology towards something fascinating. 

That’s when I came across the Neuralink 2025 Summer Update. Whitenessing how brain chips are now being integrated with robotic arms to help disabled people draw, I had an idea of what I could integrate EEG with—robotics! Thus originated this project, a system which relies solely on EEG input to control the stop and go motor commands of an m-Bot.


### Mission Statement
As I worked on this project, my goal became to create a simplified BCI(Brain Computer Interface) with basic EEG equipment. Pivoting from the $300+ commercial EEG headband to a more DIY setup, I wanted to create a system that could make EEG and BCI related projects more affordable and accessible. 

This project is geared towards students, so that we can bridge the gap between neuroscience and robotics through easy to follow, exciting projects. Ultimately, through this project, I hope more students can gain exposure and develop an interest for BCI and the future of technology!
