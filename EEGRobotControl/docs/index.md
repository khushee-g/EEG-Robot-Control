Welcome to the EEG Robot Control webpage. Here, I’ll cover how to control a M-Bot with EEG(electroencephalography) signals from start to finish. If you would like to follow along, check out the step-by-step YouTube tutorial or my GitHub repository.

### Inception 
This project started after I first began using a Muse EEG headband. The headset was designed for tracking sleep quality, but when used with third-party apps, I could use it to acquire raw EEG data in real time. Doing so, I saw my own brain waves being captured, and I became curious to learn more. 

My first EEG work was focused on analyzing biomarkers in the eyes-closed and eyes-open state, and through this I found that the brain exhibits fluctuations in alpha wave activity as we relax and close our eyes.

This was my first step towards understanding EEG, but I still had yet to apply this technology towards something fascinating. 

That’s when I came across the Neuralink 2025 Summer Update. Whitenessing how brain chips are now being integrated with robotic arms to help disabled people draw, I had an idea of what I could integrate EEG with—robotics! Thus originated this project, a system which relies solely on EEG input to control the stop and go motor commands of an m-Bot.


### Mission Statement
As I worked on this project, my goal became to create a simplified BCI(Brain Computer Interface) with basic EEG equipment, so that more students can gain hands-on experience in this domain. Pivoting from the $300+ commercial EEG headband to this DIY setup which costs less than $50, I hope to make EEG and BCI related projects more affordable and accessible.
