The headset was designed for tracking sleep quality, but when used with third-party apps, I could use it to acquire raw EEG data in real time. Doing so, I saw my own brain waves being captured, and I became curious to learn more. </p> <p>My first EEG work was focused on analyzing biomarkers in the eyes-closed and eyes-open state, and through this I found that the brain exhibits increased delta wave activity as we relax and close our eyes. This was my first step towards understanding EEG, but I still had yet to apply this technology towards something fascinating. </p> <p>That\u2019s when I came across the Neuralink 2025 Summer Update. Whitenessing how brain chips are now being integrated with robotic arms to help disabled people draw, I had an idea of what I could integrate EEG with\u2014robotics! Thus originated this project, a system which relies solely on EEG input to control the stop and go motor commands of an m-Bot.</p>"},{"location":"#mission-statement","title":"Mission Statement","text":"<p>As I worked on this project, my goal became to create a simplified BCI(Brain Computer Interface) with basic EEG equipment. Pivoting from the $300+ commercial EEG headband to a more DIY setup, I wanted to create a system that could make EEG and BCI related projects more affordable and accessible. </p> <p>This project is geared towards students, so that we can bridge the gap between neuroscience and robotics through easy to follow, exciting projects. Ultimately, through this project, I hope more students can gain exposure and develop an interest for BCI and the future of technology!</p> <p>If you have any questions or ideas on this project, feel free to reach out. I would love to connect!</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/","title":"EEG-Robot-Control","text":"<p>EEG-Robot Control is a project that uses real-time EEG signals to control a robot based on the user's state of alertness.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#how-it-works","title":"How It Works","text":""},{"location":"getting-started/#user-states","title":"User States","text":"<ul> <li>Alert (eyes open) \u2192 Robot moves forward  </li> <li>Rest (eyes closed / theta detected) \u2192 Robot stops  </li> </ul> <p>By filtering EEG data in the 4\u20138 Hz (theta) band, the system distinguishes between alert and resting states and translates them into motor commands for the robot.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#eeg-signal-acquisition","title":"EEG Signal Acquisition","text":"<ul> <li>3 gel electrodes (stick-on)  </li> <li>EXG Pill amplifier  </li> <li>Arduino Uno for data capture  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/#signal-processing","title":"Signal Processing","text":"<ul> <li><code>serial-read-theta.py</code> filters EEG for 4\u20138 Hz activity  </li> <li>If theta detected, writes <code>stop</code> to a motor command file  </li> <li>Else, writes <code>go</code> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/#robot-control","title":"Robot Control","text":"<ul> <li><code>mbot-motor-control.py</code> reads the command file  </li> <li>Sends the appropriate motor commands to the robot (mBot) via serial  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<ul> <li>Python 3.x  </li> <li>NumPy, SciPy  </li> <li>Arduino Uno + EXG Pill  </li> <li>mBot (MakerBlock)  </li> <li>EEG electrodes (3 gel stick-on)  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":"<ol> <li>Run <code>serial-read-theta.py</code> to begin capturing EEG and writing commands.  </li> <li>In a separate terminal, run <code>mbot-motor-control.py</code> to control robot motors.  </li> <li>Close your eyes \u2192 robot stops  </li> <li>Stay alert (eyes open) \u2192 robot moves  </li> </ol>"},{"location":"hardware/","title":"Hardware Setup","text":""},{"location":"hardware/#materials","title":"Materials","text":"<ul> <li>Gel Electrodes (3 per use)</li> <li>3 Snap-fit Wires</li> <li>BioAmp EXG Pill by Upside Down Labs</li> <li>3 Male-Female Jumper Wires</li> <li>Arduino Uno</li> <li>2 USB Type-B Cables</li> </ul>"},{"location":"hardware/#electronics-schematics","title":"Electronics Schematics","text":"<p>To set up the EEG system, start by connecting the electrodes to the snap-fit cables, and connect the free ends to the BioAmp EXG Pill.
