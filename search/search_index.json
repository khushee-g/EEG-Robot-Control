I used red, black, and yellow cables to represent IN+, IN-, and REF respectively. Next, connect the BioAmp EXG Pill to the Arduino Uno board using the male-female jumper wires. Connect the yellow wire from the output pin to the A0 Analog Input port on the Arduino; connect the black wire from the ground pin to the ground port on the Arduino; and connect the red wire from the VCC(power) pin to the 5V port. See Diagram 1 for the complete connection setup.  </p> <p>Now connect the USB cable from the arduino board to your computer, so that the EEG signal can be processed. Connect the second USB cable from your computer to the M-Bot, in order to send the robot real-time motor commands based on the EEG input. Alternatively, you can connect to the M-Bot via bluetooth. </p>"}]}
